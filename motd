Welcome to freetserv, a free as in freedom serial terminal server.
See http://freetserv.github.io for details about this project.

The root file system is mounted read-only to minimize writes to the SD card.
Hence, here are two convenience wrapper scripts for day-to-day operations:

export NEWUSER=stapelberg
fts-adduser ${NEWUSER}      # Add a new user
fts-port-owner 1 ${NEWUSER} # Configure a serial port (range 1-48)
                            # (by default, ports are owned by “nobody”)

Then, configure an SSH public key for the user to log in:
install -d -m 700 -o ${NEWUSER} -g users ~${NEWUSER}/.ssh
install -m 600 -o ${NEWUSER} -g users /dev/stdin ~${NEWUSER}/.ssh/authorized_keys
<copy&paste public key, terminate using Ctrl-D>
